# PHP basic routing framework

This is a Fork of "The PHP Practitioner" source code from https://laracasts.com/series/php-for-beginners

It implements some more functionalities for the routing and for the DB management

## Configuration

Use Composer (https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) to link all controllers. 

```
composer install
```

Create a file in the root folder to define the environment such as `.production`, and define the corresponding `config.production.php` file.
